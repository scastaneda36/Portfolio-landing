          <h3>My Background:</h3>
            <p>My career experience is mostly in an administrative support role and customer service, but I wanted to try something different.
            One day my friend talked about a program she was in to learn about programming and it was enough to get me on board so here I am at Epicodus.
            I have no experience with coding so I look foward to what I can learn at Epicodus</p>
