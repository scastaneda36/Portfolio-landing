      <div class="well">
        <h3>My Background:</h3>
        <p>My work experience includes 5 years administrative support and over 10 years of customer service. It felt like it was time for a career change and wanted to try something different.
        One day, my friend was talking about a program she started about learning how to code. The information she shared was enough to get me on board so here I am at Epicodus.
        I have no experience with coding so I look foward to what I can learn from Epicodus</p>
