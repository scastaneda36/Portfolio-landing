    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a California native and moved up to Seattle in 2013. My career background is focused on administrative support and customer service, but I wanted to try something different.
      My friend talked about a program she is currently in to learn about programming and it was enough to get me on board so here I am at Epicodus.</p>
